**Extra info!!!!!**

* **Register Notation:** the "Argument 1" to "Argument 4" columns indicate the general-purpose registers (G1-G4) that
  hold the instruction's operands.
* **Bitwise Results(R3)**: TODO but like they go in R3
* **Result (R4):** The `R4` register holds the primary result of the instruction, if applicable. For example, the `ADD`
  instruction stores the sum in `R4`.
* **Memory Access:** Instructions like `LOAD` and `STORE` allow interaction with memory.
* **System Calls:** The `SYSCALL` instruction allows the program to interact with the operating system through system
  calls.
* **Jump Instructions:** `JMP`, `JZ`, and `JNZ` provide flow control within your program.
